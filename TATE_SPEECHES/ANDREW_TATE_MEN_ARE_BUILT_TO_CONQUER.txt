my point is I don't understand or I don't fathom the concept of fun I don't wake up and think what can I do for fun I don't wake up and think what is fun I want fun that never crosses my mind I wake up and think I have things to do and if I don't have things to do I'll find things to do you can always do more work you could there's no such thing as no work to do after this podcast is done you can release it and you can make X amounts of Clips that's going to be done and then you could watch watch you it back and you could analyze every word you've ever said you could find a way to say it differently you could look at dictionary and find new words and you could learn them and you could memorize them then you could sit down and you could rehearse it and use those words and sentences to make sure you pronounce them correctly you don't make any mistakes then you could always do more work from the same thing the work is never ending the money is never ending so you have to find joy in your work you have to find purpose at least I don't know if I even find joy in my work cuz I'm stressed and annoyed I'm furious all the time what do you mean we've made $1.3 million today is a joke flip the computer but it's it's you have you have to conquer the Earth let's talk about this why did genas Khan wake up and think you know what what can I do for fun I can play this instrument not [ __ ] play the instrument for me boring okay let me [ __ ] this girl [ __ ] her let me [ __ ] her kid number 84 boring what's s do you know what you know what guys let's all get our horses and let's just ride over there and and who whatever we find let's just take it why because it's the instinct to conquer it's inside of a man it's been dumbed B Down By The Matrix they try and numb you they numb you with entertainment they try and put you in the festival crowd they numb you with [ __ ] food they numb you with depression all this other garbage but truthfully if you're a man you look in the mirror what will make me happy my Empire will make me happy that's why Alexander the Great did what he did and Julius Caesar did what he did and genas Khan did what he did they didn't have Google Maps they didn't know where they were going they said no we've decided we're gonna go take [ __ ] from other people and show we're the best and that's what we're doing now the successful men at least in a financial sense why am I making money I have nothing to buy there's nothing to buy I have it all I have four kernin eggs a rimac a Bugatti 53 other cars 40 properties there's nothing to buy I'm just taking it from other people I'm winning the game I'm conquering and that's what I think truly is going to give you purpose in life it's just Conquest men have always been this way that's why War was even happening in the first place the Mongols raided Vienna how long does it take to ride from anulan Batar Mongolia on a horse to Vienna Austria across all of Siberia and they were still mad enough and bored enough to go n we need that City over there that's the masculine Essence and it's been numbed down inside of people do you think they were ever considering fun at any point during this Conquest cuz I don't think they were well do you think they were just trying to dominate others I don't think it's about trying to to dominate I think that inside of every single man there's a a god-given I think that the entire world was built by this god-given drive to conquer and to conquer doesn't always mean dominate others you can conquer the Sky by building a skyscraper you can you can conquer by building roads you can conquer by construction not only by destruction you conquer by turning up to a new territory and having a beautiful family and creating children I think that's inside of every single man I think it's been dumbed down by the Matrix but I'm uninterested in fun I don't understand the concept of fun fun is for women and children all the women around me have fun last night last night I went to a restaurant my brother and I three or four friends maybe 25 of the most beautiful women you've ever seen in your life we sit down at this table all this fancy food comes all these balls of champagne come everyone comes the girls are laughing drinking everyone's having fun never at any point during the entire experience did I have any fun I sat down on my phone checked how much money I had again did some work replied to important people spoke to my fight coach about training and important things spoke to the War Room about important things in Conquest spoke to my legal team everyone around me is having fun I'm getting things done looks like I'm having fun but never did I ever for a second feel fun and I didn't want to I didn't try and join in the fun I didn't try and go yeah yeah no I pay for it all you all have fun I'm going to do this and I say this there's a I say this all the time to the people I care about your life is fun and my life is stress but you are mine that's how it works you're my woman so you're allowed to have fun and my life is going to stay stressed but you are mine I have my fun via proxy by making sure everybody I love have fun I don't want any fun so you have fun in providing I provide fun but I don't have any fun I don't even have fun in providing fun it's just my obligation everyone around me has fun I'm working
