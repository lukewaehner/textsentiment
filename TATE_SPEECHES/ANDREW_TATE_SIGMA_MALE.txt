i don't believe in depression
don't message me about depression
because i don't believe in it
if you're asleep in your bed in the
middle of the night and you hear a noise
and you believe in ghosts
now you're afraid but if you don't
believe in ghosts that's the wind and
you go back to sleep you give the ghosts
power by believing in them your house is
only haunted if you believe in ghosts
belief is a powerful thing i would stand
in front of you
and i were to tell you that i could
punch you as hard as i can in your
sternum and i could fracture it and send
a splinter into your heart would you
allow me to try
you wouldn't because you know i believe
i can
i believe i could hurt any man on the
planet and that's why people are afraid
of you and you believe depression is a
crippling disease and that's why you're
afraid of it
