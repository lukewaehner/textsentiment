with great power comes great [Music] responsibility my content existed because I tried my very hardest to be an absolute not a realist especially with uncomfortable truths I was pointing out that very uncomfortable is that a truth it's an uncomfortable truth in many parts of the world it's not a truth that I'm happy about I don't want to be seen as a negative influence in the world I know that there's a whole bunch of men I get thousands of emails a week from men whose lives I've saved I get thousands of emails a week from men who were on the verge of suicide and I've saved their lives I believe in protecting and providing I've been misunderstood I don't want anybody to be offended by anything I say I want to be a positive force in the world I don't want anybody to hear what I say and make them feel bad about themselves I want all people to live righteous and good whether they're male or female I think righteous is living true to your heart and knowing that you're doing good by people not snaking anybody not lying to anybody I know I live a very righteous life the government is not capable of helping the poor and this is why it's so important as a person you take personal responsibility and understand you're living in a world where the Matrix can be cracked you can make a bunch of money but you need to take responsibility and do it I refuse to accept that there are people out there who cannot become happy contented individuals I refuse to accept we live in a world where God has created people who no matter how hard they work and how good their life becomes can't be happy I don't accept that I accept that the universe is a very giving place and that God loves all of us and if you try your best and you work hard you can become a better person I'm telling the younger generation that if they don't get up and work hard and make sure that they're important that the world's not going to giveit about them 99% of my content was men telling them the truth saying that as a man you're born with no inherent value you have to become important you have to go through some pain or go through some suffering to make people care about you otherwise you're not going to matter as a dude if you walk into the party and youve put no effort into your life nobody gives [ __ ] nobody about you and every man out here knows and one of the great things about the masculine journey and masculinity is that we've all lived a semi- similar story it's kind of cool like we've all been the teenager gets heartbroken we've all been unimportant we've all like worked hard and then started to get some clout and then we've all kind of lived the same kind of Journey so I say to everybody out there yeah if you don't follow that path and follow that journey in one way or another get to the top whether it's fighting whether it's comedy whether it's musici whatever it is if you're just going to stay somewhere near the bottom and then at the age of 44 you know email me saying I'm depressed well of course you're depress loser but that was your choice because you you have to build yourself as a man and if you decide not to build yourself then then your life's going to suck my main message is to resist a slave mind uh to understand that every single thing you're being told has an agenda behind it or you wouldn't be told it otherwise to examine every strongly held belief you have and try and identify where it comes from and why you have it I sit and argueing with people I discuss things with people and they so fervently believe a point and I say why do you believe that so much like do you have personal experience no but I saw the news the news told you X and now you are desperate you will sit here for hours arguing that point A lot of people are completely empty vessels ready to be programmed and I try and tell people listen to just stop for a second and and understand that the things they're telling you to believe are not necessarily for your benefit the people who make the rules don't make the rules for the benefit of everybody they make the rules for the benefit of the people who make the rules the game so um telling people to resist a slave mind and just be critically critical thinkers keep their brain open pay attention to things be perspicacious that's the general theme and it doesn't matter whether you're left right liberal man woman Etc it's just think for yourself that's the general message I believe men and women are beautiful Union I think we're slightly different but when we work together we're the most powerful force in the world and I certainly believe that men and women when they work together is the most beautiful force in the planet so of course I believe in men and women of course I believe in love of course I believe in marriage of course I believe in family I believe in marriage in the traditional sense I believe a man has a duty to stand up and be a real man I believe that the problem with the world today that we are facing is that not enough men are sticking to the age-old ways of masculinity I believe that me standing up and saying a man must protect a woman and provide for her so he needs to make sure that she's safe he needs a degree of authority I believe women are sovereign individuals and they can make any choice they so desire I think that it's important that we remember that a man has a duty I think I certainly in my relationship have a financial responsibility to provide for my woman my woman would never have to work unless she wanted to because I'm the kind of person who works hard enough and I'll make another point that needs to be said the number of women who have stood up and stuck up for me is ignored thousands of women are making videos saying I've met Andrew Tate he's such a nice guy I wish I had a man like Andrew Tate who felt responsible to protect him provide for me you know what I I do belong to my husband that's why I married him and I love him we ignore the thousands of women who stood up and and and stood by me and said everything I said is true this is that there's a large contingent of men who still want to make money go to the gym be strong drive a fast car be traditionally masculine and don't want to be shamed for that I believe that feeling depressed is real I don't believe depression as a clinical disease is real no I think PTSD is very real unfortunately I have some friends who suffer from that I know that feeling depressed is is real I believe that the number one power you have against these things are taking trying to take control of your own mind and affecting your own life I believe that it's not healthy to hand over all your power and believe that depression is an outside disease that you can't affect I know that when I've had difficult periods in my life and also many of my friends like I've said suffered from PTSD and been through terrible things I've lived a very difficult life and I know people who have that the things that made them feel better is when they woke up and said you know what I'm not going to allow this to damage me anymore I'm going to take respons possibility I'm going to get up and I'm going to fight this as hard as I can if someone comes to me and says I'm clinically depressed or I feel very very sad I would say the first thing you need to do is stop accepting the identity of a clinically depressed person stop accepting you have no control over this and what you need to do is stop identifying that way and let's work together to try and fight against a lot of people who are clinically depressed are suffering with something in their life and if you fix the problem in their life perhaps they won't feel depressed anymore the thousands of people who have emailed me saying my doctor told me I was clinically depressed and it's a disease that I have got in my brain and I can't can't be fixed and I started listening to you and I realized that that's not the case and I can fix my own life and you're the only person who has ever helped me I believe feeling depressed is real I do not believe it's a disease that you catch from the sky and you cannot affect I believe that no matter what happens I believe you have control of your own mind and you can fight against it I believe if you change your circumstances in your life you may feel different I'll give you a quick example I had a guy who emailed me saying he was clinically depressed and he was going to kill himself I obviously am not a psychiatrist I'm not a doctor I told him cuz I replied to my emails I said have you been to a psychiatrist he said yes I'm clinically depressed I've been on this pills this amount of time I've not anti depressant it doesn't work I said I don't know what to say to you besides this and he's he said he lost his girlfriend that's why I became clinical depressed I said listen go to the gym get a six-pack first once you've got a six-pack email me again if you still feel like killing yourself I don't know what else to say to you but I'd say strong body is a strong mind GO train he went he started sending me progress pictures emailing me him getting in better better shape and eventually got sixpack he's not a professional bodybuilder and he said I can't believe I was considering that I feel so much better Etc the doctor was telling him he was clinically depressed and couldn't cure it he started taking control of his own life and now he felt better that if somebody has depression of any kind whether it's clinical whether it exists or not whether they feel depressed or not whatever they taking control of their life taking personal responsibility and working hard is always going to be the positive best thing they can possibly do for their life going forward people going around them of course money can't buy happiness I agree but money is the third most important thing in the world first is your relation first is your health because you have nothing if you're going to die second is your relationships because you need love and family that matters the most but money can buy everything else so money is a third most important thing the average people come to me and say what do I do I'm just the average guy and my only answer is stop being the average guy it's my only answer you can't just be the average guy anymore the I the idea from the 1950s that you can just be the normal average law-abiding hardworking Citizen and you'll have a good life is gone any man out here who goes I'm just going to work hard do my bit and obey the laws and I'll have a good life no you won't no you will not just doing your job is never going to make you rich cuz you're just going to be taxed into Infinity and you're going to stay broke so just obeying laws and doing your job now has set you up for to be a peon a slave for attorney you have to get yourself in a position where you're making enough money you don't know what to talk about then you don't understand money so go learn how money Works go learn how Bank Works go sit on YouTube for free you don't need to pay 50 Grand in four years like a university go sit on YouTube and understand money banking or the real estate market any of it understand the the last housing price crash why it happened understand mortgage rates and how that's affected by interest rates understand it and then go sit with someone else who understands it and talk about it people should even if they haven't got a penny in the world should be going to these meetings about real estate about investing that especially if it's cheap they should go just meet other people who at least have money have conversations about money talk about it how you going to get what you don't talk about and yes the cycle of precipitation right so uh a cloud comes it rains it falls down to the ground it it goes under under the ground whatever goes into a stream it moves into the stream goes to the ocean evaporates again up into a cloud floats somewhere else falls down again it's always moving that's how money is people think that money is in these large stagnant pools hden hidden in people's bank accounts that's not really true money is constantly moving all the time and if you can find a way to get in between it and stand in the right place at the right time you're going to get wet I think that's the new modern way to view the world is an attention economy it doesn't matter what you do if you're getting attention you'll make money from it one habit that people need to adopt and this is a habit I had for a very long time I've actually recently cleared it from my brain because I've reached a point where peace of mind is worth more than money but every single time money is spent you need to identify how your money was taken from you and I say taken because money can't be made money is taken because the only people who can make money are the government so if you're a government you can make money you can print it from th air or a bank but if you're a person you're not making money you're convincing other people to give it to you you're taking money from others so every single time you spend money on anything you need to identify how it was taken from you when you go and buy a coffee don't just go buy the coffee and sit down sit and say why did I buy this coffee okay I really wanted coffee yeah but then why did I go into this store and not that store is it bare advertising does they have less of a line do they have seaing how did they convince me to come in here how much did this coffee cost six quid what's the profit margin on that probably 5505 80 probably by the time the cup probably cost more than the coffee the coffee is just water how did they convince me to spend six pounds in this place and when you sit there and analyze and you all start to learn little lessons about business you'll learn about the importance of the signage you learn about the importance of there being no queue yeah so that if you ever run a business tell you I say with my business my people all the time faster all the time quicker yeah like I have a couple businesses that are physical I'm like I don't want to see a line I don't want to see empty because it looks bad so when there's lines you work fast we're down to one or two people you take your time you talk to the customer keep it so there's like always one person at the like manage the line like people don't think about this stuff no one's going to sit and wait and long you maybe some idiots will but people like me won't we got to do right my time's worth money I'm not going to stand wait in the line so you have to identify how your money is taken from you if you start doing that with every single time you spend anything ever you're going to start to identify business opportunities and you're going to sit there and you're going to have coffee and you're going to go you know what they could have sold cake and they didn't could I out compete this place let's imagine I had the money to start a coffee shop right next door how would I out compete them well I'd have cake cuz they don't have cake also most people in here are businessmen and this the guy serving some dude no we need a cute waitress his ass is fired we need a chick put a chick here put some cake in uh Financial Times business people in think people don't even think about this stuff they don't use their brain ever they don't ever look around and realize how they're Lo spending their money they don't look around and look at which businesses are successful they don't look around and pay attention to anything they don't look at the world and all the things are happening and how it can benefit them none of it they don't look at any of it they're too busy following the circus is why it's clown world I was walking to school to college with a couple of my friends and a Ferrari drove past and I said bro you see that and he goes yeah what about it I said doesn't that piss you off I must about 16 he goes why this dude has 400 G's for a car 400 Grand I'm walking four miles to college cuz my mom hasn't got any car he has 400 Grand do you think he works a job do you think he's behind a counter somewhere he know knows something about the world that I don't know and they were like well he's he's Rich I'm like yeah I know I didn't say he wasn't Rich dummy I'm saying he knows something about the world I don't know and I was intrigued and it angered me I couldn't sleep for weeks I was pissed off every time I saw somebody with genuine money I understood that everything I was being told and taught and and and and they were trying to make me believe just simply wasn't true I was like this is none of these people are getting these things by following the path that the system is trying to make me follow and everybody intrinsically knows this if you go to a if you if you're at a BP you're at Petrol Station and I pull up in my Lamborghini nobody goes wow he went to school he studied hard and and they do that because they know that the mo the easiest way to amass wealth is to break the rules because the rules are not designed to allow most people most people to make money you can make money within the rules of course you can but most people don't most people who follow the path work consume die that's it so I always knew the same thing as you and I knew there had to be another way I knew that just working for money was a paradigm that that wasn't true and then you understand making your money work for you and you understand dinking your time from money you start learning to understand these things but eventually you build a system and you build an ecosystem like me I have 60 or 70 people work for me for me all around the world and things just happen and money just kind of appears as long as everything's well organized I mean in my experience like imagine if if I had didn't have all this money and I had to go get a job again I'd get a sales job because I've always been a Salesman and uh I I think that's a very important life skill to have to be good at sales and to deal with the stress and have a commission only environment but they don't even I don't know if they even teach sales in University yeah it's all garbage they don't teach they don't teach anything important they just teach anything they teach things that are going to keep you inside the slave mind and they want you to go to school and then go to college and then go to university and get in debt and you have to be in debt so that now you have to work and you're working and you're in debt and then they want you to take on more debt if possible in the in the form of a mortgage which a lot of people do which we can talk about cuz I the property guy and then you're in debt now and once you're in debt you can't really quit your job and it's very difficult for you to leave the country and and now they have now they can hold things over you that's the goal it's all about control mechanisms and the system is very well designed to make sure that people are uh conditioned to obey it's very hard for the average person to say no to anything unless you have millions and millions and millions of dollars it's very difficult to even have an opinion on subjects that's the thing about being a man and that's what I was saying to the kids was like look you need to get up and it's going to be very very difficult the world's getting harder and harder especially for men it's all clout it's all status it's all there's no way you're going to matter unless you get up and you work extremely hard should young men aspire to work very hard have no criminal record become multi-millionaires protect and provide for the women close to them uh be Sovereign so they can stand up and have their own points of view in face of cancellation be able to not be mentally intimidated when they go on national TV and there's traps set up for them yeah I believe that confident strong men who stand up and protect and provide for women are a good thing for the world and a good Force for the world and I don't think that I put a magic spell on anybody I think there's a whole bunch of men in the world who understands my value and if if men grow up to be like me you're going to have a whole bunch of people with no criminal record dedicated athletes who protect and provide for the people close to them
